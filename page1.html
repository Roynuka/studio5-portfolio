                <blockquote><p><strong>Week 1 - Start of Studio 5</strong></p><p><strong>Session 1 - 20/7/20</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">First session of studio 5 we were introduced to various projects for the semester. Each one different and we had to choose what project we wanted to do. For myself the journey to get here has been rather difficult and also I didn't have a clear path for what I wanted to do. I was torn between Robotics and Dev Ops with the last resort being Mobile Development. In the end I chose to go with Dev Ops.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">After getting familiar with the rest of the Dev Ops Team a separate group was formed under Rob Broadley. His goal was to move everything from the kate and maridb servers to the cloud. The next 6 months/semester being the designing and planning stage and from there the studio 6 students will be implementing it the following semester, Semester 1 2021.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Our Team leader Fasial then assigned Jae, and I (studio 5) some tasks to go through for the week.</span></p><p><strong>Session 2 - 23/7/20</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1.09rem;">I was still trying to find my place in the team. Although I was given tasks my Fasial to work on it was still confusing as our separate group 'Robs Army' has other stuff too. So I wasn't sure how things were operating at this stage. Long story short I dont know what I'm doing.&nbsp;</span><br></p></blockquote>

Something that we will be learning throughout the semester. It was interesting listening to what she had to say especially coming from someone that has worked in the industry while also being a past BIT student.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Afterwards I finally looked into the tasks Fasial tasked me with. Watching a video on AWS and familiarizing myself with Azure and the services it offers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Session 2 - 30/7/20</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">One of the team members Yan explained to me tasks the Dev Ops have been doing up until now. From monitoring, ticketing, Azure and other stuff. I was finally able to understand what needed to be done and where I come in. Up to this point I was feeling a bit unsure and just wanted to help out and do what I can to contribute to the team. So today I was assigned the task of setting up notifications for Zabbix, a monitoring system that monitors the BIT servers. Hope all goes well from here but its a start.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

However, we had a very interesting and eye opening meeting with Ange. Basically the meeting was an overview of what we're planning to do this semester. Going through the servers and shutting down those that were deemed not needed. It gave me an insight of what happens in the industry being a part of the meeting. It was definitely and experience worth remembering.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Session 2 - 6/8/20 , Rob's Army</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">To kick of the start of studio 5 today Scott, and I were tasked by Rob to look into some router problems he had. Basically there was a 'faulty' router that apparently had no system image on it. So it was to be sent back. We were then told to go through 6 old routers to check which 2 had the latest versions. The 2 routers with the latest versions could also run ipv6. We were unable to complete the task in the given studio5, project 2 time but managed to do so after hours. Yan joined Scott and I in completing the task.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
